            <strong>4. HOW DO WE USE AI AND MACHINE LEARNING?</strong>
          </h2>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We use machine learning in a limited and
          purpose-specific manner to improve our ability to extract passcodes
          from text.
          <p>
            As part of our Services, we utilize a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
            model to identify and extract passcodes from text. This model is
            built specifically for this purpose and does not generalize beyond
            passcode extraction. It is not used for broad AI applications or
            generalized machine learning tasks.
          </p>

          <p><strong>How We Train Our NER Model</strong></p>
          <p>
            Our NER model is trained using user-provided passcode data from
            within our system. This training allows the model to accurately
            recognize and extract passcodes based on structured patterns,
            improving the efficiency of our service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data used to train this model is strictly limited to
            passcode-related information and is not repurposed for any other AI
            applications. We do not use this data to train generalized AI
            models, nor do we share it with third-party AI systems.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Data Security and Privacy</strong></p>
          <p>
            All data used for training our NER model is processed in accordance
            with our Privacy Notice. We implement strict security measures to
            ensure that passcode-related data is handled safely and not retained
            beyond its necessary use for improving our model’s accuracy.
          </p>

          <p><strong>How to Opt Out</strong></p>
          <p>
            We respect user control over data usage. If you prefer not to have
            your passcode-related data contribute to model improvements, you
            can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Log in to your account settings and update your preferences.

          <h2><strong>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></h2>

          necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice
          unless otherwise required by law.
          <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
            notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
            than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>
          <h2><strong>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></h2>
          <strong>In Short: </strong>We aim to protect your personal information
          through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
            organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
            any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
            and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
            over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
            hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will
            not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
            protect your personal information, transmission of personal
            information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
            only access the Services within a secure environment.
          </p>
          <h2><strong>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></h2>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or
          market to children under 18 years of age.
          <p>
            We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to
            children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such
            personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you
            are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a
            minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If
            we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
            age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take
            reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.
            If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children
            under age 18, please contact us at info@factorvault.com.
          </p>
          <h2><strong>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></h2>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your
          account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of
          residence.
          <p>
            <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your
            consent to process your personal information, which may be express
            and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
            right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
            consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
            provided in the section "<a href="#contact"
              >HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a
            >" below.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
            processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows,
            will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted
            in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

          <h2><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></h2>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
          Notice.
          <p>
            California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
            browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
            legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
            respond to them at this time.

          <a href="https://factorvault.com/contact-us"
            >https://factorvault.com/contact-us</a

          <p>
            Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
            authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a
            request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that
            they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in
            accordance with applicable laws.
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Request Verification</strong></h3>
          Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
          determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
          in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
          request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
          However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information
          already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional
          information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
          security or fraud-prevention purposes.
          <p>
            If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need
            to collect additional information to verify your identity before
            processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written
            and signed permission from you to submit such request on your
            behalf.
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Appeals</strong></h3>

          action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing
          us at info@factorvault.com. We will inform you in writing of any
          action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a
          written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal
          is denied, you may submit a complaint to your state attorney general.
